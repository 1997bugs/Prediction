# Prediction

## Objective -
Objective of this exercise is to accurately infer the gender of given set of devices using a machine learning approach. We need to predict the unknown gender for devices based on their device Information, app usage, app description and other features.

## Data -
The following datasets are provided : 
1. Train Dataset and Test Dataset containing deviceId – “ifa” and other aggregated information along with target variable “gender”
2. App Metadata dataset containing app, app description and other information regarding apps. There could be multiple keys here like appId, id, bundleId, etc.. Choose the id the would help utilize the dataset most in conjunction with other datasets.
3. User App propensity dataset containing deviceId - “ifa” and propensity measure against apps (“bundle”) for all deviceIds (both train and test dataset)
